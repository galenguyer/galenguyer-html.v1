                Hi, I'm Galen! I've interned twice at Microsoft, in the summers of 2018 and 2019. In 2018, I was on the
                Office Security Penetration Testing team, and in 2019 I was on the One Customer Voice team. Currently,
                I'm a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, studying Software Engineering. In my free time,
                I do way too much programming. If you wanna see a lot of it, check out my github,
                <a href="https://github.com/galenguyer">github.com/galenguyer</a>. My
                <a href="/Galen-Guyer-Resume.pdf">resume</a> is also available, though far less expansive.
            </p>

                If you're interested in getting in touch for whatever reason, the easiest way to do that is over email
                at <a href="mailto:galen@galenguyer.com">galen@galenguyer.com</a>!
